### Important Next Step
If you have already committed some of these files (like `.ipynb_checkpoints` or a `.pth` file) to git, simply adding them to `.gitignore` won't remove them. You must run this command in your terminal to clear the cache:

```bash
git rm -r --cached .
git add .
git commit -m "Fix .gitignore and remove cached files"
